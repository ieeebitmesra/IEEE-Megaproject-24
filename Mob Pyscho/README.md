## Domain of the Project  
Artificial Intelligence and Web Development  
Our project combines AI-powered tools and web development to simplify and automate the process of creating websites , web applications and android applications.

## Idea  
Our project introduces an AI Website Builder and a Flutter App Builder with the following features:  
1. AI Website Builder:  
   - Allows users to generate react projects using prompts.  
   - Uses an AI Agent to interpret the prompt and make web requests directly in the browser.  
   - Integrated with OAuth for secure authentication.  
   - Utilizes Gemini 2.0 Experimental Flash for enhanced performance.  

2. Flutter App Builder:  
   - A drag-and-drop interface for creating Flutter-based apps.  
   - Automatically generates Flutter code based on the designed UI.  
   - Streamlines app development for both beginners and experienced developers.  

## Achievements Thus Far  
- Successfully implemented the AI-powered prompt-to-web request functionality in the website builder.  
- Integrated OAuth for user authentication and data security.  
- Built a fully functional drag-and-drop interface for the Flutter app builder.  
- Achieved seamless Flutter code generation from UI designs.  
- Leveraged Gemini 2.0 Flash to enhance AI responsiveness and overall performance.  

## How to Execute the Code Samples  

### AI Website Builder  
1. Prerequisites:  
   - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  
   - Clone the repository:  
     bash   
     cd website-builder  
       
   - Install dependencies:  
     bash  
     npm install  
       
2. Run the Project:  
   - Start the server:  
     bash  
     npm run dev  
       
   - Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.  
3. Usage:  
   - Log in using OAuth.  
   - Enter a prompt (e.g., "Create a personal portfolio website").  
   - View the generated project.  

### Flutter App Builder  
1. Prerequisites:  
   - Install [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  
   - Clone the repository:  
     bash   
     cd app-builder  
       
   - Run flutter pub get to fetch dependencies.  

2. Run the Project:  
   - Start the Flutter app:  
     bash  
     flutter run  
       
3. Usage:  
   - Use the drag-and-drop interface to design the app UI.  
   - Click Generate Code to view or download the Flutter code.  

## Future Scope  
- Expand the AI's capabilities to support more complex prompts and frameworks.  
- Add more components and templates to the drag-and-drop Flutter app builder.  
- Integrate support for deployment to cloud platforms directly from the interface.
