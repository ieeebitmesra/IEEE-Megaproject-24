## Domain of the Project
Crowd Souurcced Disaster Management

## Idea
SAFE REACH is a crowd-sourced disaster management application designed to operate effectively even without internet connectivity. It allows users to request assistance (medical, food, SOS), report local issues (e.g., roadblocks, fallen trees), and find or donate essential resources such as groceries and medical supplies. Admins and rescuers receive detailed distress calls, post real-time updates, and provide emergency guidelines to the affected communities.

**Key Features:**
 - **Offline Functionality:** Utilizes LoRa and ESP32 modules to ensure communication even in network-deprived areas.
 - **Crowd-Powered Disaster Mapping:** Users contribute live updates to build a dynamic and responsive disaster map.
 -  **All-in-One Platform:** Combines communication, resource management, real-time updates, and rescue coordination in a single platform.
 - **Resource Donation Network:** Users can donate and locate essential supplies, fostering community resilience.

## Tech Stack Used
- Application Development Framework - Flutter
- Backend - NodeJs, Django
- Database - Firebase
- APIs - Weather APIs, Location Services (Google Maps API)
- IoT Devices - ESP32, LoRa Modules (Long-range communication)
- Satellite Communication - C-Band (For emergency communication with government approval)
- Sensors - Environmental monitoring (water level)

## Acheivements So Far
- Successfully developed a working prototype with core features such as distress call management, real-time updates, and resource tracking.
- Developed the mobile app using Flutter, ensuring smooth performance across Android and iOS devices.
- Designed login functionalities for Users, Admins, Businesses, and NGOs with customized dashboards.
- Implemented LoRa-based communication to ensure seamless operation even in no-network zones.
- Integrated Firebase for cloud data storage and user authentication.
- Developed a crowd-powered disaster map aggregating user reports and sensor data for real-time situational awareness.
- Enabled users to donate essential supplies and locate nearby resource stations effectively.
